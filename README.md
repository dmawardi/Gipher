# Gipher
> A page that allows the user to search the Giphy API using buttons containing search terms for API calls.
Monash Web App Development Week 6: Gipher

The Gipher application uses the Giphy API to pull the top 20 GIF results for a particular search term. Search terms can be added in the form of buttons on the top, which call the API and populate results on when the user clicks on it.

The results are populated in the bottom right section of the page and are initially static.  By clicking on the image, the user is able to view a moveable GIF version of it.

## Installation

No Installation required

## Usage example

Searching for video game GIFS for sharing with friends?  You can use the default buttons that are on the site to search through GIFS associated with the game-titles.

Don't see the game you need GIFS for?  You are able to add custom buttons using the form on the left-hand side of the page. This allows you to add custom search terms.
